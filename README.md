# JavaScript-Quiz

## Description 
The task here was to create a timed JavaScript quiz that saves your highscores, and penalizes you for wrong answers. Javascript was the main focus for this task in order to have all operations operating when the website is prompted to be used. 

## Acceptance Criteria
<br> GIVEN I am taking a code quiz <br>
<br> WHEN I click the start button <br>
<br> THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question <br>
<br> WHEN I answer a question <br>
<br> THEN I am presented with another question <br>
<br> WHEN I answer a question incorrectly <br>>
<br> THEN time is subtracted from the clock <br>>
<br> WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 <br>>
<br> THEN the game is over <br>
<br> WHEN the game is over <br>
<br> THEN I can save my initials and score <br>

## Usage 
As soon as you're on the page, you'll be prompted with instructions and to start the quiz. Once the quiz has started, you'll have 50 seconds to complete five questions. Every answer you get wrong, you lose 10 second. At the end of the quiz, you'll be asked to save your score with your initials. You'll be able to see all of your scores using the highscores tab at the top.
